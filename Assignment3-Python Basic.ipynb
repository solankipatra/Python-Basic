    "1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "The advantages of using functions are:\n",
    "Reducing duplication of code.\n",
    "Decomposing complex problems into simpler pieces.\n",
    "Improving clarity of the code.\n",
    "Reuse of code.\n",
    "Information hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "when it is called\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "The keyword def(): creates a function\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "A function call means invoking or calling that function. Unless a function is called there is no use of that function. ... So the difference between the function and function call is, A function is procedure to achieve a particular result while function call is using this function to achive that task\n",
    "\n",
    "5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "There's only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time you were to run the program, the names would remember their values from the previous run\n",
    "\n",
    "Local scope is a characteristic of variables that makes them local (i.e., the variable name is only bound to its value within a scope which is not the global scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "When the execution of the function terminates (returns), the local variables are destroyed. Codelens helps you visualize this because the local variables disappear after the function returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "A return is a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task. A return value can be any one of the four variable types: handle, integer, object, or string. The type of value your function returns depends largely on the task it performs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python return statement is a special statement that you can use inside a function or method to send the function's result back to the caller. A return statement consists of the return keyword followed by an optional return value. The return value of a Python function can be any Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "If expression is omitted, the return value of the function is undefined. ... If no return statement appears in a function definition, control automatically returns to the calling function after the last statement of the called function is executed. In this case, the return value of the called function is undefined\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "If you want to refer to a global variable in a function, you can use the global keyword to declare which variables are global.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "None is used to define a null value. It is not the same as an empty string, False, or a zero. It is a data type of the class NoneType object. Assigning a value of None to a variable is one way to reset it to its original, empty state.\n",
